# Employee-Record-Management-System by Pratham Prajapati

The Employee Record Management System, developed using Python, SQL, Object-Oriented Programming, and Tkinter, is a comprehensive solution for managing employee data, thereby enhancing operational efficiency.

This system is built upon robust data management principles using SQLite, which ensures secure storage, retrieval, and manipulation of employee data. It transforms the traditionally complex process of maintaining accurate employee records into a streamlined operation, thereby enabling employers to fulfill their legal obligations, mitigate potential litigation risks, and gain insights into their employeesâ€™ backgrounds.

The system leverages Tkinter to design an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI), which facilitates seamless user interaction. The interface includes fields for capturing employee details and provides options for adding, updating, and deleting records.
